""" Basic module to ease the use of pyOSC module https://trac.v2.nl/wiki/pyOSC

you must have pyOSC installed for this to run.

This is meant to be used by students or newies that are starting to experiment with OSC. If you are an advanced user
you probably want to bypass this module and use directly pyOSC, we have some examples of very simple use in our website.
Check the pyOSC website for more documentation.
