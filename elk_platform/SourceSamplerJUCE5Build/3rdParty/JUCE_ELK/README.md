JUCE is an open-source cross-platform C++ application framework used for rapidly
developing high quality desktop and mobile applications, including VST, AU (and AUv3),
RTAS and AAX audio plug-ins. JUCE can be easily integrated with existing projects or can
be used as a project generation tool via the [Projucer](https://juce.com/discover/projucer),
which supports exporting projects for Xcode (macOS and iOS), Visual Studio, Android Studio,
Code::Blocks, CLion and Linux Makefiles as well as containing a source code editor and
live-coding engine which can be used for rapid prototyping.

## Getting Started
The JUCE repository contains a [master](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/tree/master)
and [develop](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/tree/develop) branch. The develop branch
contains the latest bugfixes and features and is periodically merged into the master
branch in stable [tagged releases](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/releases)
(the latest release containing pre-built binaries can be also downloaded from the
[JUCE website](https://shop.juce.com/get-juce)).

The repository doesn't contain a pre-built Projucer so you will need to build it
for your platform - Xcode, Visual Studio and Linux Makefile projects are located in
[extras/Projucer/Builds](/extras/Projucer/Builds)
(the minumum system requirements are listed in the __System Requirements__ section below).
The Projucer can then be used to create new JUCE projects, view tutorials and run examples.
It is also possible to include the JUCE modules source code in an existing project directly,
or build them into a static or dynamic library which can be linked into a project.

For further help getting started, please refer to the JUCE
[documentation](https://juce.com/learn/documentation) and
[tutorials](https://juce.com/learn/tutorials).
