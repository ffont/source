	<h2>In a nutshell</h2>
	<div class="sectiontext">

		<p>
		<strong>ttymidi</strong> is a GPL-licensed program that allows external 
		serial devices to interface with ALSA MIDI applications.
		The main motivation behind <strong>ttymidi</strong> was to make 
		<a href="http://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a> boards talk to MIDI applications
		without the need to use (<a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/Labs/MIDIOutput">or build</a>)
		any extra hardware.
		</p>

	</div>

	<h2>Usage</h2>
	<div class="sectiontext">
		<p>
		If you are using an Arduino board, simplest will be to use
		<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/MIDILibrary">
                Arduino MIDI library</a>, as described in the following sections.
                You may also use less sophisticated ardumidi library that is provided
                with ttymidi download package. If you are
		using another device, you should read the rest of this page to see how
		your device should communicate. Once your device is programmed and
		connected to your PC, <strong>ttymidi</strong> is executed in the
		following manner:</p>
		
<!--		If are using an Arduino board, you must first program it with the
		provided MIDI library, as described in the next section. If you are
		using another device, you should read the rest of this page to see how
		your device should communicate. Once your device is programmed and
		connected to your PC, <strong>ttymidi</strong> is executed in the
		following manner: -->
		</p>

		<p>
		<pre>ttymidi -s /dev/ttyS0 -b 9600</pre>
		</p>

		<p>
		Where <code>/dev/ttyS0</code> is the serial port you want to read from,
		and <code>9600</code> is the bitrate. For Arduino with serial connection
                runnning at 115200bps (the default rate for <strong>ttymidi</strong>)
                the command would be:
		</p>

		<p>
		Arduino Diecimila:
		<pre>ttymidi -s /dev/ttyUSB0 -v</pre>
		</p>
		<p>Arduino UNO:
		<pre>ttymidi -s /dev/ttyACM0 -v</pre>
		</p>

		<p>
		Where the <code>-v</code> gives me <em>verbose output</em>, which helps
		me when I'm debugging.
		</p>

		<p>
		<strong>ttymidi</strong> creates an ALSA MIDI input and output ports that can be 
		interfaced to any compatible program. This is done in the following manner:
		</p>

		<p>
		<pre>
# start ttymidi
ttymidi -s /dev/ttyUSB0 &

# start some ALSA compatible MIDI 
# program (timidity, in this case)
timidity -iA &                    

# list available MIDI input clients
aconnect -i                       

# list available MIDI output clients
aconnect -o                       

# connect
aconnect 128:0 129:0

# ...where 128 and 129 are the client 
# numbers for ttymidi and timidity,
# found with the commands above</pre>
		</p>

		<p>
		If you would like to use a graphical interface to connect your MIDI 
		clients, you can use something like 
		<a href="http://qjackctl.sourceforge.net" />qjackctl</a>. As for
		the program that will consume the MIDI data, there are many out there 
		(other than <a href="http://timidity.sourceforge.net">timidity</a>, which
		was used in the previous example). Some crowd pleasers are
		<a href="http://fluidsynth.resonance.org/">fluidsynth</a>,
		<a href="http://www.puredata.org/">puredata</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.essej.net/sooperlooper">sooperlooper</a>
		and <a href="http://www.ardour.org">ardour</a>, 
		to cite a few.
		</p>

		<p>If you are using automated patchbay connecting application, such as
		the patchbay feature of qjackctl or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/aj-snapshot/">
		aj-snapshot</a> you might want to rename the name of ttymidi client created by using
		<code>-n</code> flag.</p>
		<p><pre>ttymidi -s /dev/ttyUSB0 -v -n my_weird_controller</pre></p>

	<h2>Programming your serial device</h2>
	<h3>Arduino MIDI library</h3>
	<div class="sectiontext">
		<p>ttymidi is nowadays compatible with
                <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/MIDILibrary">Arduino MIDI library</a>
		and we strongly recommend using it when communicating from Arduino to ttymidi.
		You only need to remember to call <code>Serial.begin(int baud_rate)</code>
		immediately after <code>MIDI.begin(int channel)</code> on your patch as
		the serial port of your computer is not able to operate at MIDI baud rate
		that MIDI library is using. For example:</p>
		<p><pre>
void setup() {
  MIDI.begin(4);        // will listen incoming MIDI at channel 4
  Serial.begin(115200); // will change baud rate of MIDI traffic from 31250 to 115200
}
</pre></p>		
		<p>You'll find MIDI library examples with these changes made in ttymidi
                download package.</p>
</div>
<h3>Arduino interface</h3>
<div class="sectiontext">
		<p>This chapter explains how to use deprecated (but still functional)
                ardumidi library instead of Arduino MIDI library. To interface to
                <strong>ttymidi</strong>, the serial-attached device must
		send data in MIDI-format. 
		In the case of Arduino boards, a library is provided that abstracts all
		the nitty-gritty details away. Below is a list of the available 
		functions:
		</p>

		<p>
		<pre>
// Start/stop playing a certain note:
midi_note_on(byte channel, byte key, byte velocity);
midi_note_off(byte channel, byte key, byte velocity);

// Change pressure of specific keys:
midi_key_pressure(byte channel, byte key, byte value);

// Change controller value (used for knobs, etc):
midi_controller_change(byte channel, byte controller, byte value);

// Change "program" (change the instrument):
midi_program_change(byte channel, byte program);

// Change key pressure of entire channels:
midi_channel_pressure(byte channel, byte value);

// Change pitch-bend wheel:
midi_pitch_bend(byte channel, int value);

// Check if a MIDI message has arrived from the PC
int midi_message_available();

// Get a MIDI message from the PC
MidiMessage read_midi_message();

// Get the pitch bend value from a MIDI message
int get_pitch_bend(MidiMessage msg);

// Send a comment:
midi_comment(char* str);

// Send a series of bytes (to be interpreted by another program):
midi_printbytes(char* bytes, int len);</pre>
		</p>

		<p>
		Where the parameters are in the range: channel (0&ndash;15), 
		pitch-bend value (0&ndash;16383), all other values (0&ndash;127).
        The center position of the pitch-bend wheel is 8192.
		</p>

		<p>
		Since MIDI uses numbers to represent notes, a few useful constants 
		are defined in this library. With them, it is much easier to deal with
		MIDI nodes. For example:
		</p>

		<p>
		<pre>midi_note_on(0, MIDI_C + MIDI_SHARP - 2*MIDI_OCTAVE, 127)</pre>
		</p>

		<p>
		All notes refer to the 4th octave by default. So the line above
		plays a C#2. As a shortcut to the 1st octave, constants such as
		<code>MIDI_C0</code> can be used.
		</p>

		<p>
		Similarly, when receiving MIDI messages from the PC, you can use 
		constants to figure out type of the incoming message:
		</p>

		<p>
		<pre>if (midi_message_available() > 0) {
	MidiMessage msg = read_midi_message();
	if (msg.command == MIDI_NOTE_ON && msg.channel == 0) {
		/* 
		Since this is a "Note On" command, we know that 
		- msg.param1 is the MIDI note 
		- msg.param2 is the "velocity" of the note 

		How do we know this? See the <a href="#miditable">table</a> below.
		*/
	}
}</pre>
		</p>
		 
		<p>
		There are a couple of things to keep in mind when using <em>MIDI in</em> features of
		<strong>ardumidi</strong>. Firstly <code>midi_message_available()</code> will always
		flush the incoming Serial buffer of all non-MIDI data. In practice this
		means that you can't mix using the Serial library and
		<strong>ardumidi</strong>
		(unless you know what you are doing). Secondly the incoming Serial buffer
		of arduino can store at most 42 MIDI commands so you have to take care
		that buffer does not overflow. However this does not cause your patch to crash,
		only couple MIDI messages are lost.
		</p>
	
		<p>	
		To install the <strong>ardumidi</strong> library, just copy its folder
		into Arduino's <code>sketchbook/libraries</code> directory.
		Also note that an example Arduino sketches are included in the 
		<strong>ttymidi</strong> package. They should appear under Examples
		in Arduino IDE after you have succesfully installed the library.
		For instance, <code>ardumidi_test</code>, will play one C-minor
		chord every second.
		</p>

	<div class="sectiontext">
	<h3>General interface</h3>
		<p>
		If you are using another serial device in place of the Arduino, you'll
		need to program it to follow the MIDI specification. To sum this up, most
		of the commands sent to <strong>ttymidi</strong> are comprised of 3 bytes:
		</p>

		<p>
		<pre>
byte 1       byte 2           byte 3
status       parameter #1     parameter #2</pre>
		</p>

		<p>
		Where <code>status</code> is a combination of a <code>command</code> and a 
		<code>channel</code>. Why is it called status? I haven't a clue, but that's
		the name in the MIDI spec. The table below describes the codes for each
		command as well as their associated parameters.
		</p>

		<p>
		<a name="miditable"></a>
		<table>
			<tr class="topheader">
				<td></td>
				<th>code</th>
				<th>parameter #1</th>
				<th>parameter #2</th>
			</tr>
			<tr class="odd">
				<th class="leftheader">note off</th>
				<td class="hex">0x80-0x8F</td>

				<th class="leftheader">pressure</th>

			<tr class="even">

			<tr class="odd">

				<td>range MSB</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="even">
				<th class="leftheader">bytes</th>
				<td class="hex">0xFF</td>
				<td>0</td>
				<td>0</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		</p>

		<p>
		Most of these commands and parameters are self-explanatory. All parameters
		are given as a number in the range 0&ndash;127. That is, they're all 7-bit
		numbers with a 0 padded to their left (i.e.  <code>0xxxxxxx</code>) in order
		to make up 1 full byte (8 bits). For channel pressure and program change you
		should send only one data byte.
		</p>

		<p>
		One odd MIDI command is the <code>pitch bend</code>, whose parameter is a
		14-bit number. For this reason, it is split into two parts: a least 
		significant byte (LSB) and a most significant byte (MSB). These can be 
		easily computed by quick logical <code>and</code> and <code>shift</code> operations:
		</p>

		<p>
		<pre>
int range = 12345;
byte range_lsb = range & 0x7F;
byte range_msb = range >> 7;</pre>
		</p>

		<p>
		The <code>bytes</code> command provides a way to send non-MIDI data
		through the serial port without messing up with <strong>ttymidi</strong>. 
		All you need to do is send <code>0xFF 0x00 0x00 len data[0] data[1] ...</code>,
		where <code>len</code> is the number of <code>data[&bull;]</code> in 
		the message. When seeing such messages, <strong>ttymidi</strong> will
		just print them to the screen (but not parse them), so you can use this
		to print comments from your serial device. You can also use it with 
		<code>sprintf</code> for debugging.
		</p>

		<p>
		You may have noticed that, for all commands, the 1st byte always has a 1
	   	as the most-significant bit, while the other 2 (or 1) bytes always have a 0.
		This comes from the MIDI spec, and is used by <strong>ttymidi</strong>
		for data alignment purposes. Do not try to change that in your 
		serial device's program, or it will royally mess things up.
