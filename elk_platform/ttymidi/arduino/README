NOTE that ardumidi library is becoming obsolete, but will still be present
in our distribution package as an example how to communicate with ttymidi at
computer end. For those of you who are not interested in such an excursion,
we advice downloading Arduino MIDI library, which is now (almost (read further))
compatible with ttymidi:

http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/MIDILibrary

When using MIDI library, please check our example patch as there is one small
detail that you have to remember when using MIDI library together with
ttymidi (you have to call Serial.begin(115200) after MIDI.begin(int) command.
You can copy the example patch demonstrating this like so:

cp -r MIDI /path/to/arduino/sketchbook/libraries/

You should install MIDILibrary before doing this. Example patch will appear
to examples dialog of Arduino IDE.

If you still want to install the Arduino ttymidi library (which I so aptly
named "ardumidi"), just copy the ttymidi folder into the Arduino libraries folder:

cp -r ardumidi /path/to/arduino/sketchbook/libraries/

This library comes with example sketches. Please take
a look at them, as they contains information on how to use the library.
